- **Charge(C):**
	- quantity, Coulomb
	- It's the amount of water 
- **Current(A):**
	- rate of flow of electric charge $I=\frac{Q}{t}$ 
	- It's how much water flows per second 
- **Voltage(V):**
	- Energy transferred per unit of Charge $V=\frac{W}{Q}$ 
	- It pushes the water 
	- $V=IR$
- **Power(W):**
	- Rate of energy transferred $J/s$  
	- $P=VI$ 
- **Passive Reference Configuration(PRC):**
	- When current enters from terminal marked positive 
- **Energy Absorbed:** Power is positive, (if battery then its charging)
- **Energy Supplied:** Power is negative, (if battery then its discharging)
- **Note:**
	- Measuring the Power of Battery if Current **enters** from the -ve part then Current is negative, and if Current **enters** from +ve part then Current is Positive 
	- With Current source if Current enters from the tail of the arrow(-ve part) then Current is negative and vice versa 

- Rules:
	- $I=\frac{Q}{t}$ 
	- $V=\frac{W}{Q}$
	- $V=IR$
	- $P=VI$

- **KCL:**
	- $I_{input}=I_{output}$ 
- **KVL:**
	- Negative side of battery, Resistant against current $\to -V_b$ 
	- Positive side of battery, Resistant along current $\to V_b$ 
	- Current moves from higher Volt(+) to lower Volt(-)
	- Current source $\to$ fixed current, arrow goes from $-\to+$ 
	- $V_1=R_1\frac{V_t}{R_{eq}}$ 
- **Connections:**
	- **Current:**
		- Series: Constant
		- Parallel: Divided
	- **Voltage:**
		- Series: Divided
		- Parallel: Constant
	- **Resistance:**
		- **Series:** $R_{eq}=R_1+R_2+R_3$
		- **Parallel:** $\frac{1}{Req}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}$
