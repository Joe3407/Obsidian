- **Charge(C):**
	- quantity, Coulomb
	- It's the amount of water 
- **Current(A):**
	- rate of flow of electric charge $I=\frac{Q}{t}$ 
	- It's how much water flows per second 
- **Voltage(V):**
	- Energy transferred per unit of Charge $V=\frac{W}{Q}$ 
	- It pushes the water 
	- $V=IR$
- **Power(W):**
	- Rate of energy transferred $J/s$  
	- $P=VI$ 
- **Passive Reference Configuration(PRC):**
	- When current enters from terminal marked positive 
- **Energy Absorbed:** Power is positive, (if battery then its charging)
- **Energy Supplied:** Power is negative, (if battery then its discharging)

- Rules:
	- $I=\frac{Q}{t}$ 
	- $V=\frac{W}{Q}$
	- $V=IR$
	- $P=VI$
