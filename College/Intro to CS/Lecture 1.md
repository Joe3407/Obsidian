## Data, Information & Information Processing Cycle

#### Data vs Information

| Aspect     | Data (Raw)                                                          | Information (Processed)                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Raw facts, symbols, or numbers with no meaning on their own (input) | Organized/processed data that has meaning and context (output) |
| Example    | `5, 12, 19` (random numbers)                                        | "Velocity = 10 m/s" (meaningful statement)                     |

#### Information Processing Cycle

**Flow (IPOS):**  
**Input (data) → Processing (work) → Output (information) → Storage (save for later)**

- **Purpose:** Convert raw data into useful information.

## Computer Components

#### CPU & GPU 
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The "brain" of the computer.
  - Controls and executes instructions.
  - Has **cores** = processing units inside CPU.
    - Dual-core = 2 cores, Quad-core = 4, Multi-core = many.
    - More cores → can handle more tasks at once.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Supports CPU.
  - Handles images, video, animations, 3D rendering.

#### Storage: Primary vs Secondary
| Aspect     | Primary Memory                                        | Secondary Memory                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Fast, temporary memory used while computer is running | Slower, permanent storage for long-term use |
| Examples   | RAM, Cache, ROM                                       | HDD, SSD, USB drives                        |
| Usage      | Holds data/programs currently in use                  | Stores files, software, and OS permanently  |
> **Note:** Whenever the computer needs data from secondary memory, it first loads it into RAM. The CPU then accesses it from RAM, because RAM is much faster than secondary storage.
#### Communication Devices
- **Definition of Network:** Two or more computers connected to share data/resources.
- **Examples:** Ethernet card, Wi-Fi adapter, Printer
